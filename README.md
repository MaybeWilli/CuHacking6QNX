A simple inverse kinematics controller running in QNX written for a 2 DOF servo arm.

Made for CuHacking 6, Mar 16 2025.

Wiring:
Base signal - GPIO 18
Elbow signal - GPIO 13
Button1 - 10k ohm resistor - GPIO 20
Button2 - 10k ohm resistor - GPIO 16

Everything powered off of 5v and GND of the rasp pi. Apparently, it stays under 1.2 amps.
